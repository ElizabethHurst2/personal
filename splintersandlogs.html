SPLINTERS AND LOGS 
    </h1>
    <p style="color: black">
    Splinters and Logs was first created by Caroline Woolard
      and Christine Wang in 2008 when they took out a lease on an 8000 square foot space in Brooklyn to build affordable artists studios
      and community. In it's initial manifestation, SnL accomodated up to 25 artists with flexible work space and a shared kitchen. I took over 
      management of the studio in 2013. 
      <br /><br />
      In 2016, Mitchell Dose and I formed our own LLC, took over the project completely and moved Splinters and Logs to Red Hook, Brooklyn, where we designed and built
      a space to accomodate six working artists. Our goal was to co-create artist housing in New York 
      that works for artists, and an environment in which every residents creative practice and security is mutually supported. 
      <br /><br />
      Collaborating artists have included the McMullan brothers, Ben Bush, Maggie Sullivan, Aimee Lutkin, Claire Beaumont, Mitchell Dose, Patrick Costello, Tom Cunningham, Caroline Woolard,
      Christine Wang, Alex Nathanson, Rebecca Zakheim, Calvin Stalvig, Iso Vento, Evelyn Manlove, and so many more.
