 CARNIVAL
    </h1>
    <p style="color: black">
      Metal amusement park ride built in 
      collaboration with Mitchell Dose using a salvaged car bearing. A phone camera was attached to the ride and video phootage of riders 
     was projected onto the kitchen wall through video call between kitchen and roof. Carnival also included games and dollar store prize 
      giveaways designed by Patrick Costello and Ben Simon, plus tarot readings by Calvin Stalvig.
