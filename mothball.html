 MOTH CYANOTYPES

      <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 13px;"><i>  Moth Ball is a summer solstice gathering of humans and other creatures, seen and unseen. It is part citizen science project, and part site-specific outdoor pageant. 
      A ritual, an immersive piece of performance art, a banquet, and an experiment, with the goal of calling attention to the often invisible webs that embed us within ecosystems. 
      It reminds us that in fact, each one of us contains ecosystems ourselves â€“ as holobionts, we overlap and damage and nourish and extract and create life simply by existing.</i>

     In order to make the 12 cyanotype panels, Sarah and I built a carrying device for the exposure surface out of scrap wood that we were able to 
       carry in and out of a small house frame that we transformed into a dark room and rural studio. We used sand, bark, plant trimmings, rocks, roots, 
       twine and moon negatives to create our series of unique earthen skyscapes.
