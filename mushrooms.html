MUSHROOM HOUSES    </h1>
    <p style="color: black">
    This day-long workshop explored woodland ecology and saprophytic fungi as part of a Wood-themed camp. We learned about
      the similar needs of fungi and humans for survival, and designed houses for mushrooms. 
      We built the houses using wood scraps, included windows for the mushrooms to grow through, and finished by lining them with 
      plastic and packing them with coffee grounds and oyster mushroom spawn. Each mushroom house builder 
      went home with a Mushroom Growing Handbook. Beam Center, 2016.
