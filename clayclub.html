 CLAY CLUB
    </h1>
    <p style="color: black">
      Clay club is a group of people who meet to make things with clay, share food, and hang out. We are all self taught 
      in ceramics and use the space to experiment and learn from each other. Together we've explored slip casting, silt casting, high 
      fire vitrification, marbling, and much more. We also <a href="smallchange.html"target="_blank">organize</a> together and use 
      the products of our efforts to raise money for mutual aid and community. 
      Once you're a member of clay club, you're always a member of clay club.
