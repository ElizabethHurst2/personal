ARCADE STATIONS
    </h1>
    <p style="color: black">
  The concept for Beam Team is that I offer a theme, technical guidance, a bunch of odds and ends to play with,
      and a series of connected prompts and students work in pairs to brainstorm, design and build out ideas. 
      At the end of the program, we invite family and friends to come experience and celebrate what's been made.
<br />
      <br />
During the 2019-2020 school year the theme was Arcade Stations. The team created characters out of clay and placed them into 
      computer games of their own design, designed ways to control the game using hand-made switches of all kinds, 
      and began to design
      their own arcade cabinets with real world interactions triggered by their games. They used salad bowls, hand sewing, 
      3D printing, magnets, confetti, wood working, water pumps, and more. Due to the covid-19 pandemic, we were unable to complete
      our arcade stations. Beam Center, 2019-20.
